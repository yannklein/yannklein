# Hey ✌️ I'm Yann  
<strong>
  Software Developer · Bootcamp Manager
</strong>

I'm a [maker](https://www.yannklein.dev/) at heart, passionate about building applications and exploring the edges of technology, VR, AR, and lately AI.  
*(And yes, I may or may not have a [leathercraft addiction](https://medium.com/@yann.and.the.machines/yann-and-the-machines-50540e9ec088) 🙄)*  

I'm also a people person: [changing the lives of coding bootcamp students](https://www.lewagon.com/blog/meet-our-team-yann) is what gets me out of bed every morning ❤️.  

Wanna know more? Let’s [grab a coffee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yann-klein/) ☕ or [jump on Zoom](https://cal.com/yannklein) 🎥.
