# Hey✌️ I'm Yann 

I am a software developer and bootcamp manager at (Le Wagon Tokyo)[https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo]. 
I'm a maker by essence and I love to develop applications and push the limits of fields like VR, AR or recently AI (I guess it's not the right place to talk about my (leathercarft addiciton)[https://medium.com/@yann.and.the.machines/yann-and-the-machines-50540e9ec088]? 🙄). 
I'm also a people person, (changing the life of our coding bootcamp students)[https://www.lewagon.com/blog/meet-our-team-yann] is the reason why I wake up every morning ❤️. 
Wanna know more? Let's grab a coffee in Tokyo ☕️ or on Zoom 🎥 !
